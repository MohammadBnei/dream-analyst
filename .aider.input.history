+/code We are at a fresh start. I just pulled a starter template for sveltekit and postgres with tailwind and daisyui. Here is my app idea : A dream analyst with genAI capabilities. The goal is simple : we want the user to write or speak their dream, and have it saved it in the database and analysed by AI. The analysis will also be saved. Start by outlining the README document so we are clear on our goals

# 2025-10-25 17:12:27.704369
+Create the outline of the readme which will contain the description of our application as I just told you

# 2025-10-25 17:15:49.729441
+We will use a n8n instance to handle the AI generation

# 2025-10-25 17:17:01.209986
+We will use a n8n instance to handle the AI generation. Update the readme

# 2025-10-25 17:19:30.521699
+Now, looking at +page.server.ts as the example, create a migration file in the lib folder to handle the creations of our table. The previous attempt created a schema.sql file, but I want to have only ts files.

# 2025-10-25 17:20:32.724117
+Create the user table, simple with username, email, password (hashed), and timestamps

# 2025-10-25 17:21:59.356789
+I want to have the migrations checked at the start of the app

# 2025-10-25 17:24:14.953648
+create the migrate.ts file

+Perfect. Now, create a home page with a quick description of our dream analyst app and a CTA to write our first dream

# 2025-10-25 17:27:08.418569
+modify the page. Also, make sure to match with +page.server.ts 

# 2025-10-25 17:27:40.250129
+I want a simple home page for now, no data fetching.

+Now, let's focus on the user flow. I want classical flow : user auth (login, register, logout), cookie based jwt, and locals to have the user's data
