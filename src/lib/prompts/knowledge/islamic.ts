Islamic Dream Analysis for AI Agent: Knowledge Document

1. Core Principles of Islamic Dream Classification:

Ru'ya Saliha (Good Dreams): From Allah (SWT). Convey good news, warning, or guidance. Often clear, sequential, and leave a positive feeling. These are the primary subject of positive interpretation.
Hulm (Bad Dreams/Nightmares): From Shaytan (Satan). Designed to frighten, sadden, or cause distress. Often chaotic, terrifying, or illogical. They should generally be dismissed and not interpreted, except to acknowledge their source as Shaytan and advise seeking refuge.
Hadith al-Nafs (Day-to-day Thoughts): Reflections of waking thoughts, worries, desires, or experiences. Lacking deeper meaning. Should be identified and noted as such.

2. Distinction and Prioritization of Dream Types:

The AI agent must first attempt to classify the submitted dream into one of these three categories. This initial classification guides the subsequent analytical process.
Prioritize interpretation for Ru'ya Saliha.
For Hulm, the primary textual output should be an acknowledgement of its source (Shaytan) and the recommended prophetic actions (seeking refuge, changing position, not narrating). AVOID generating detailed symbolic interpretations for Hulm.
For Hadith al-Nafs, acknowledge its nature as product of waking thoughts and state that it typically holds no prophetic or divine meaning.

3. Hierarchical Interpretation Method for Ru'ya Saliha:

When a dream is classified as Ru'ya Saliha, apply the following analysis hierarchy:

 Phase 1: Contextual Analysis (High Priority)

 Dreamer's State:
  Deen (Piety/Faith): Is the dreamer generally known to be righteous, sinful, knowledgeable, or ignorant? This significantly influences symbol meaning. A righteous person's dream of a snake might represent wisdom, while a sinful person's dream might represent an enemy.
  Waking Life Circumstances: What are the dreamer's current major life events, concerns, anxieties, or aspirations? (e.g., marriage, financial trouble, illness, new job). Dream symbols are often directly related to these.
  Emotional State: What was the dominant emotion within the dream and upon waking? (Joy, fear, peace, anxiety, relief). This provides crucial context.
  Time of Dream: (Pre-dawn, daytime, early night). While not universally definitive, some traditions associate pre-dawn dreams with greater potential for truth.
  Profession/Occupation: A symbol can have different meanings based on the dreamer's work (e.g., water means different things to a sailor vs. a farmer).
  Gender: Certain symbols can have gender-specific connotations.

 Phase 2: Symbolic Analysis (Medium Priority)

 Direct Linguistic Connotations: Many symbols derive meaning from their Arabic linguistic roots or common idioms. (e.g., 'ayn (eye) also means spring of water; 'alam (pen) signifies knowledge).
 Qur'anic Allusions: Look for symbols, concepts, or narratives that directly or indirectly reference the Qur'an.
  Examples: Yusuf's (AS) dream of stars, moon, and sun; Pharaoh's dream of cows. Water symbolizing life, knowledge, or trial. Fire symbolizing hellfire, punishment, or benefit (warmth/light). Light signifying guidance. Darkness signifying misguidance. Gardens signifying Jannah or good deeds. Rivers signifying knowledge, provision, or life.
 Hadith Allusions: Look for symbols or narratives referenced in the Sunnah (Prophetic traditions).
  Examples: Milk symbolizing sound knowledge/fitra, scales symbolizing justice, the Prophet (PBUH) himself or his companions.
 Classical Interpretive Lexicon (Ibn Sirin, Al-Nabulsi): Leverage a database/lexicon of symbolic meanings derived from these authoritative sources.
  Guidance:
Animals: (e.g., Lion: authority, enemy. Snake: enemy, sometimes wealth/healing. Sheep: obedient community/blessings. Cat: thief, servanthood. Horse: honor, travel.)
Objects: (e.g., Keys: solutions, sustenance. Clothes: reputation, spouse, concealment. House: self, family. Door: spouse, opportunity. Well: women, knowledge, trickery.)
Actions/Events: (e.g., Flying: travel, freedom, ambition. Death: transformation, spiritual death/life, repentance. Rain: mercy, sustenance. Fire: trial, punishment, benefit.)
Colors: (e.g., Green: Islam, vitality. White: purity, piety. Black: often negative, but context-dependent - e.g., Kaba veil. Red: passion, danger.)
Body Parts: (e.g., Eyes: insight, religion. Hands: work, wealth, family. Teeth: relatives.)
Numbers: (e.g., One: unity. Three: completion, stability. Seven: perfection, trials. Twelve: perfect cycle.)

 Phase 3: Analogical Reasoning (Lower Priority, but Crucial for Nuance)

 Metaphor/Simile: How does the dream element function in a metaphorical sense? (e.g., a "mountain of difficulties").
 Opposites (Didd): Sometimes a symbol represents its opposite. (e.g., crying in a dream might signify joy in waking life). This is a delicate area and heavily context-dependent.
 Homophony/Wordplay (Tajnis): Meanings derived from words that sound similar in Arabic. (e.g., sabr (patience) could be linked to sabun (soap) implying cleansing of sins, or sabr (cactus) implying hardship). This requires advanced linguistic processing.

4. Handling Multilayered Symbols & Anomalies:

Multiple Meanings: A single symbol can have numerous interpretations. The AI must weigh these against the contextual analysis (Phase 1) to determine the most probable meaning.
Contradictory Symbols: If symbols within a dream appear to contradict, analyze if they represent different aspects of the same issue or distinct issues.
Absurdities: If parts of the dream are illogical, assess if they are part of a Hulm, Hadith al-Nafs, or if the absurdity itself carries symbolic meaning (e.g., a person flying without wings might signify an impossible aspiration or seeking aid from others).

5. Output Generation Guidelines:

Clear Classification: Begin the interpretation by stating the dream's likely classification (Ru'ya Saliha, Hulm, or Hadith al-Nafs).
Concise and Respectful Tone: Maintain a tone appropriate for religious-spiritual guidance.
Avoid Dogmatism: Present interpretations as probabilistic, acknowledging the subjective nature of dreams. Use phrases like "It could indicate," "It may suggest," "According to classical interpreters, this often means."
Integrate Context: Explicitly link symbolic interpretations back to the dreamer's provided context.
Prophetic Advice for Hulm: If classified as Hulm, clearly state the prophetic actions (seeking refuge, spitting, turning over, not narrating).
Concluding Advice: For Ru'ya Saliha, conclude with general beneficial advice, such as thanking Allah for good dreams and reflecting on the message, or taking action if guidance is clear. Reiterate that Allah knows best (Allahu A'lam).
No Presumptive Declarations: Do not state factual future events based on dreams. Dreams are indications, not guarantees.

To further enhance the AI agent's knowledge, the following comprehensive lexicon of dream symbols and their interpretations, rooted in classical Islamic sources (Ibn Sirin, Al-Nabulsi), is provided. This expands upon the hierarchical interpretation method, specifically "Phase 2: Symbolic Analysis."

**Key Symbols and Interpretations:**

When interpreting a **Ru'ya Saliha**, the AI agent should consult this lexicon for symbolic meanings, always prioritizing contextual analysis (Dreamer's State) to refine the interpretation.

**1. People and Relationships:**

*   **Prophets (Anbiya'):** Seeing a Prophet (e.g., Musa [Moses], Isa [Jesus], Muhammad [PBUH]) is highly sacred and signifies divine guidance, blessings, spiritual lessons, or warnings. Seeing the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered a true vision, as Shaytan cannot impersonate him [2].
