# Dream Analyst

A SvelteKit application designed to help users record and analyze their dreams using Generative AI.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this application is to provide a platform where users can:

1. **Record Dreams:** Users can input their dreams, either by typing or speaking, and have them securely stored.
2. **AI Analysis:** Leverage Generative AI to provide insightful analysis of the recorded dreams.
3. **Save Analysis:** Store the AI-generated analysis alongside the original dream for future reference.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** SvelteKit
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Backend:** SvelteKit (with potential for serverless functions for AI integration)
* **AI:** Generative AI (specific model to be determined, e.g., OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, etc.)

## Features (Planned)

* User authentication and authorization.
* Dream submission interface (text input and voice-to-text).
* Secure storage of dreams and analyses in a PostgreSQL database.
* Integration with a Generative AI service for dream interpretation.
* Display of dream analysis to the user.
* User dashboard to view past dreams and analyses.
